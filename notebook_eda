recently mentioned how she loved flowers in the rain. John recounted a
time when he could still see and his glaucoma was not as terrible. Marsha
took her time with each flower, smelling each and every one as she joyously
walked by. They stopped by a park to have some donuts and coffee. Marsha
seemed hungrier than ever, as she was begging and bothering John for his
last donut. John, unable to see Marsha, put his hand out to push her back.
To his surprise, his friend Marsha was not his friend at all, but his seeing
eye dog!"""
